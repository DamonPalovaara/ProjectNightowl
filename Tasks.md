## Finish Tutorial
- Get familiar with gpu buffers

## Build Menu system
- Implement buttons
- Add functionality to change settings/options
- Implement a method to switch between different screens (e.g. main menu, options, levels, etc.)

## Create Generalized Math Object
- Would be same level of abstraction as a level in a game
- Contains properties such as position, scale, and rotation
- Implement methods for transforming the object (e.g. translate, rotate, scale)
- Implement methods for drawing the object (e.g. line, triangle, circle, etc.)

# Timeline
